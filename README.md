# Jetton Deployer - Contracts

> Starter template for a [Jetton](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TIPs/issues/74) project

This project contains everything you need to deploy a new token (Jetton contract) to TON blockchain.

&nbsp;
## Option 1: Deploy a standard Jetton using your browser

This is by far the simpler option if you want to use the standard Jetton code. You will not need to install any tools on your machine, just open up your web browser, fill-in some data about your token in the HTML form and click deploy.

#### Instructions:

1. Make sure you have a TON wallet with at least 0.25 TON balance. Supported wallets include [TonHub](https://ton.app/wallets/tonhub-wallet) and [Chrome Extension](https://ton.app/wallets/chrome-plugin).

2. Use your web browser to open the site of the deploy form: https://jetton.live

    > Safety Notice: The form is [open source](https://github.com/ton-defi-org/jetton-deployer-webclient) and served from [GitHub Pages](https://ton-defi-org.github.io/jetton-deployer-webclient)

3. Fill in the information about your Jetton in the form - choose a name, ticker and image.

4. Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your wallet.

5. Deploy and approve the deploy transaction in your wallet.

6. Once the token is deployed, the deploying wallet will receive all the tokens that were minted.
